## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-20

### Added
- Initial release of VibeNotify extension
- Smart AI chat idle detection with configurable silence periods
- Automatic command extraction from fenced code blocks
- Support for multiple shell languages (bash, powershell, cmd, zsh, fish)
- Interactive notifications with action buttons
- Command execution via terminal or VS Code tasks
- Sound notifications with customizable audio files
- Status bar indicator with toggle functionality
- Comprehensive configuration options
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Features
- **Chat Idle Detection**: Monitors text document changes and detects when AI conversations become idle
- **Command Extraction**: Intelligently extracts shell commands from code blocks with language inference
- **Notification System**: Shows interactive notifications with options to focus chat or run commands
- **Terminal Integration**: Execute commands in named terminals or VS Code tasks
- **Configuration Management**: Extensive settings for customizing behavior
- **Status Bar Integration**: Visual indicator of extension state
- **Sound Support**: Optional audio notifications with webview-based playback

### Commands
- `vibenotify.toggle` - Enable/disable the extension
- `vibenotify.testNotification` - Show a test notification for debugging
- `vibenotify.runLastExtractedInTerminal` - Execute the most recently extracted commands
- `vibenotify.showSource` - Focus the active document

### Configuration Options
- `vibenotify.enabled` - Enable/disable extension (default: true)
- `vibenotify.silenceMs` - Silence period in milliseconds (default: 3000)
- `vibenotify.chatMatchers` - File patterns for chat documents (default: ["*chat*", "*ai*", "*gpt*", "*claude*"])
- `vibenotify.notifyWithSound` - Enable sound notifications (default: true)
- `vibenotify.soundFile` - Path to notification sound file (default: "media/notification.mp3")
- `vibenotify.showStatusBar` - Show status bar indicator (default: true)
- `vibenotify.terminalName` - Name for created terminals (default: "VibeNotify")
- `vibenotify.useTasks` - Use VS Code tasks instead of terminal (default: false)
- `vibenotify.autoRevealOnFinish` - Auto-focus editor when chat finishes (default: true)

### Technical Implementation
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- **Event-Driven**: Reactive architecture using VS Code's event system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal of resources and event listeners
- **Cross-Platform**: Uses only stable VS Code APIs for maximum compatibility

```

### Dependencies
- **Runtime**: No external runtime dependencies
- **Development**: TypeScript, @types/vscode, @types/node
- **VS Code API**: Uses stable APIs (1.74.0+)

### Known Limitations
- Sound playback requires webview creation (may have slight delay)
- Command extraction limited to fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Terminal execution depends on system shell availability
- File pattern matching uses simple glob patterns

## [Unreleased]

### Planned Features
- Enhanced command extraction with natural language processing
- Support for more programming languages and shell types
- Customizable notification templates
- Integration with popular AI chat platforms
- Command history and favorites
- Batch command execution with dependency management
- Advanced file pattern matching with regex support
- Notification scheduling and quiet hours
- Extension API for third-party integrations

### Potential Improvements
- Reduce webview overhead for sound playback
- Add command validation before execution
- Implement command output capture and display
- Add support for interactive commands
- Improve error messages and user feedback
- Add telemetry for usage analytics (opt-in)
- Implement command templates and snippets
- Add support for remote development environments
